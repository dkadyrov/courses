## Assignments

### Project 1 

This first project will be a presentation on an engineering topic of your choice. The subject can be anything from the history of engineering, innovations and technologies, specific individuals and engineers in the field, or a specific recent event in engineering. The presentation should be 20-30 minutes long and should include a visual component (PowerPoint, Prezi, etc.). The presentation should be engaging and informative and should be presented to the class. 

### Project 2

The second project involves utilizing the skills we learned in class to build a small project. This project can be anything from using CAD software to design a small or large object or using Python to develope a game, simulation, or data analysis. If you are feeling uninspired, you are welcome to do a literature review on a specific engineering topic. The project should be presented to the class and should be engaging and informative.

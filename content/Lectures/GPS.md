What happens if we lose GPS?

## Description

Many of us rely on GPS technology to navigate our way through life, but recent news about new Russian space-based military capabilities has raised concerns about the safety and security of this technology. GPS was first developed in the 1970s by the United States military, and has since become widely available to the public. It has been joined by other global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) launched by China, Russia, and the European Union. These systems provide position, navigation, and timing (PNT) capabilities that are used in a variety of industries. However, threats and attacks on the system have exposed its vulnerability. In this lecture, we will explore the history and science behind GNSS, the technologies and applications that rely on it, the threats to the system, and possible alternatives in a world without GPS.

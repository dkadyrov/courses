In this assignment, you will practice some of the basic concepts of Python programming. You will create variables, perform math operations, work with strings and lists, and use dictionaries. You will submit your program as a .py file on the course website. The file should be named **lastname_firstname_assignment1.py** where last name and first name are replaced with your last name and first name.

1. Create a variable called `name` and assign it your name as a string. Print the variable.
2. Create a variable called `age` and assign it your age as an integer. Print the variable.
3. Create a variable called `height` and assign it your height in meters as a float. Print the variable.
4. Perform some math operations with your variables. Print the result of adding your age and height, multiplying your age and height, and dividing your height by your age.
5. Create a string expression that concatenates your name and age with a space in between. Assign it to a variable called `intro` and print it.
6. Use some string methods on your `intro` variable. Print the result of converting it to uppercase, lowercase, title case, and swapping the case.
7. Create a list called `hobbies` and fill it with at least three strings of your hobbies. Print the list.
8. Use some list methods on your `hobbies` list. Print the result of appending a new hobby to the list, removing the first hobby from the list, reversing the order of the list, and sorting the list alphabetically.
9. Create a dictionary called `profile` and fill it with key-value pairs of your name, age, height, and hobbies. Use the variables you created earlier as values. Print the dictionary.
10. Use some dictionary methods on your `profile` dictionary. Print the result of adding a new key-value pair of your favorite color, deleting the key-value pair of your height, getting the value of your hobbies, and updating the value of your age to one year older.

In this assignment, you will apply your python skills including `pandas` and the graphing libraries `matplotlib` or `plotly` to analyze the cereal dataset. 

The dataset contains information about 80 cereals and is available at the following link: [80 cereals](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/80-cereals).

You can choose any graphing package to generate the graphs including but not limited to `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or `plotly`. Make sure each plot is visually appealing, has a title, and has labeled axes. Make sure that the axis ticks make sense. Make each graph have a consistent theme and color scheme across all graphs.

1. Load the dataset into a `pandas` dataframe.

2. Print the first 5 rows of the dataset.

3. Use pandas to generate a description of the dataset.

4. Print the correlation matrix of the dataset. Which two columns have the highest correlation? Which two columns have the lowest correlation? Generate a correlation matrix plot using pandas.

5. Use pandas to plot a scatter matrix of the dataset.

6. Create a bar chart of the number of cereals in each manufacturer using the graphing library of your choice.

7. Generate a scatter plot of the calories vs. the rating of the cereal using the graphing library of your choice.

8. Select a few interesting looking graphs from the scatter matrix generated in problem 6 and make them visually appealing using the graphing library of your choice.

9. Create a histogram of the ratings of the cereals using the graphing library of your choice.

10. Describe any conclusions you can make about the dataset.

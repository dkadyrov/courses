In this assignment, you will practice using variables, floats, integers, strings, lists, and dictionary methods in Python. You will write a program that performs some simple calculations and manipulations on different types of data. You will submit your program as a .py file on the course website. The file should be named **lastname_firstname_assignment2.py** where last name and first name are replaced with your last name and first name.

## Problem 1: For Loops

1. Write a for loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10, one per line.
2. Write a for loop that iterates over a list of names and prints “Hello, name” for each name in the list.
3. Write a for loop that calculates the sum of all the elements in a list of numbers and prints the result.
4. Write a for loop that reverses a string and prints the reversed string. For example, if the string is `python`, the output should be `nohtyp`.
5. Write a for loop that counts how many times each letter appears in a string and prints the letter and its frequency. For example, if the string is "banana", the output should be:

> b: 1  
> a: 3  
> n: 2  


6. Write a for loop that iterates over a dictionary of students and their grades and prints the name and grade of each student who passed the course. Assume that passing is 60% or higher.
7. Write a for loop that prints the multiplication table for a given number n. For example, if n is 5, the output should be:

> 5 x 1 = 5  
> 5 x 2 = 10  
> 5 x 3 = 15  
> 5 x 4 = 20  
> 5 x 5 = 25  
> 5 x 6 = 30  
> 5 x 7 = 35  
> 5 x 8 = 40  
> 5 x 9 = 45  
> 5 x 10 = 50  

## Problem 2: While Loops 


8. Write a while loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10, one per line.
9. Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a name and prints `Hello, name` until the user enters `quit`.

## Problem 3: Conditionals 

10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number and prints whether it is even or odd using an if else statement.
11. Write a program that creates a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100 and prints the smallest and the largest number in the list using a loop and an if else statement.
13. Write a program that creates a dictionary with the keys being the names of some fruits and the values being their prices. Then, ask the user to enter a fruit name and print the price of that fruit using an if else statement. If the fruit name is not in the dictionary, print `Sorry, we don't have that fruit.`

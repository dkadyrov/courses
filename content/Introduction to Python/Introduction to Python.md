## Course Description

Python has grown into the most popular programming language utilized in a variety of applications from automation, web applications, GUI development, to robotics. The largest widespread use of Python is within the field of data science which leverages the large amounts of data for machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.

This course introduces Python through a data science lens; an accessible and practical application of Python utilized in a variety of fields including but not limited to engineering, science, finance, politics, and marketing. Students will be introduced and work through the syntax, functions, classes and methods, and packages of Python as they collect, sanitize and parse, analyze, and draw conclusions from meaningful datasets. Students will experience working with industry standard environments and packages including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Scikit-Learn as well as Git and LaTeX. Students will apply their skills to real-world datasets and problems through a few assignments and the course will culminate with a final project which the students will present at the end of term and showcase in their portfolios and resumes. No coding experience is required for the course but a general comfort with computers is expected. 

This class was developed for the Columbia Pre-College Summer Program and was taught in the summers of 2023 and 2024. The syllabus for this course is available as a <a href="/Introduction to Python/Resources/introductiontopythonsyllabus.pdf">PDF</a> .

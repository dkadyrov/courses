- Set the foundations of using Python for data science applications including:
    - Collecting, parsing, sanitizing and cleaning, standardizing, and exploring datasets
    - Generating visualizations including graphics, tables, and figures
    - Determine trends and report conclusions from analysis

### Assignments 

Daily assignments on the materials we learned in class. Most likely you will work on these assignments through the end of class and submit them at the beginning at the beginning of the next class

There will be a final project that will be presented at the end of the semester that will be a culmination of the skills we learned in class

### Git 

Git is a way to manage your code and collaborate with others. It is a version control system that allows you to track changes in your code and revert to previous versions if necessary. It also allows you to collaborate with others on the same codebase.

Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Python

Download and install Python for your operating system (OS) using the following link: 

Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

You can also utilize managers such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [PyEnv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage your Python environments. 

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code, or VSCode, is an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) that we will use to write our code. It is a popular text editor for Python and other programming languages.

Download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Once you install VSCode, you will need to install the Python extension. This extension will allow you to run Python code in VSCode. To install the Python extension, click the extensions button on the left side of the screen. Then, search for Python and install the first extension that appears. 

You can have fun and personalize your VSCode environment. You can change the theme, font, and other settings. You can also install other extensions that you find useful.

\frametitle{Nested Conditionals}
\begin{itemize}
        \item Here is another example of nested conditionals:
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
if x > 0:
    if x > 10:
        print("x is greater than 10")
    elif x > 5:
        print("x is between 5 and 10")
    else:
        print("x is between 0 and 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 0")
        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{itemize}
